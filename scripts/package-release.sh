# package-release.sh — THE canonical release-archive step. Every venue that
# turns built binaries into a release archive (release/_build.yml, the local
# artifact-flow smoke lane) runs this file; workflows provide only
# checkout/toolchain/upload around it. Archive names and contents are defined
# HERE, nowhere else, so a local artifact smoke provably exercises the same
# bytes-layout the release publishes.
#
# This script ARCHIVES what scripts/build.sh already produced; it never builds
# or synthesizes another executable.

Usage: scripts/package-release.sh <goos> <goarch> [--out-dir DIR] [VAR=VAL ...]

The canonical release-archive step: identical in the release build and the
local artifact-flow smoke lane.

  goos       linux | darwin | windows
  goarch     arch label used verbatim in the archive name (amd64, arm64,
             arm64-portable, ...)
  --out-dir  where to place the archive (default: repository root).

Make passthrough (VAR=VAL, forwarded to the build):
  CC= CXX=   compiler override, e.g. CC=clang CXX=clang++.

Environment:
  BUILD_DIR  build tree to archive from (default build/c).
  VERSION    release version stamped into the MCPB manifest (v-prefix
             accepted; defaults to 0.0.0-dev outside a release build).

Archive contents (defined here, canonical) — ONE executable, no sidecars:
  unix:    codebase-memory-mcp LICENSE install.sh THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md (.tar.gz)
  windows: codebase-memory-mcp.exe LICENSE install.ps1 THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md (.zip)

MCPB bundle (.mcpb, a zip) — darwin/windows targets plus the STATIC linux
builds; same staged binary, for MCP-Registry one-click-install hosts:
  manifest.json  server/codebase-memory-mcp[.exe]  server/LICENSE
  server/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md

Only one build variant ships: the binary carries the graph UI and the agent
integration templates inside itself, so an extracted archive is immediately
complete — no adjacent data file has to resolve for `install` to work.

# Ship every release binary stripped. Production already builds without -g, but
# the linker still keeps a ~536 KB .symtab, so releases carried their full
# symbol table to users: bigger downloads and a free map of the internals, with
# nothing gained. Nothing symbolizes at runtime (mem_profile.c is not in the
# production build and never calls backtrace_symbols), so this costs no
# diagnostics.
#
# A historical unstripped linux-amd64 artifact was the sole Microsoft detection
# in release run 30398064336, while related stripped artifacts later scanned
# clean. That is useful release evidence but not controlled feature attribution:
# engine state and other bytes can differ between observations. Independently
# of the opaque verdict, stripping removes an unnecessary symbol surface and
# does not change program behavior.
#
# macOS is ad-hoc signed by the build workflow BEFORE this script runs, and
# stripping invalidates that signature, so Mach-O is re-signed here. Skipping
# the re-sign ships a binary the kernel refuses to exec.
