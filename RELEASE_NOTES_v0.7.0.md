# v0.7.0 — Hybrid LSP across six languages, community contributions, full-platform validation

## 🧠 The headline: **hybrid LSP**

This release is the one where the **call graph stops being a guess**.

For every supported language we now ship a **hybrid Light-Semantic-Pass LSP** — a per-file, type-aware resolver that runs *inside* extraction. It tracks scopes, infers expression types, follows imports, walks inheritance, and rewrites the resolved callee on every `CALLS` edge. The plain tree-sitter pass gives you the structural graph; the LSP pass gives you the **right** callee. **Six languages** now benefit — four of them gained the LSP for the first time in this release.

### New LSPs (introduced this cycle)
| Language | What the LSP does | Headline |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** | scope binding, expression typing, method dispatch, super(), decorators, multi-inheritance, TypedDict, match/case narrowing, walrus, comprehension element typing, generics & cross-file resolution | 100% on the bench; 95% on real-world instance-attribute resolution |
| **PHP** | Light Semantic Pass, generic templates, narrowing, `self`/`static`/`$this`, trait substitution, `@phpstan-type` aliases, `Closure::bind`, variance, 278 unit tests | parity-grade across Laravel/Symfony/Doctrine/Guzzle/PSR idioms |
| **TypeScript / JavaScript / JSX / TSX** | full TS semantic surface — unions, intersections, function types, JSX element resolution, dts mode, callback-param contextual typing | the full TS dialect family, one resolver |
| **C# / .NET** | class/struct/record/interface/enum, primary constructors, indexers, accessors, LINQ chains, generics, switch narrowing | C# 12 modern features land on day one |

### Sharpened LSPs (existed at v0.6.1; substantially upgraded here)
| Language | What was sharpened |
|---|---|
| **C / C++ / CUDA** | Tier 2 pre-built per-language cross-LSP registry; template return-type substitution; namespace + class body walkers made O(n) |
| **Go** | Tier 2 + **Tier 3 metadata-driven cross-LSP** (skips the AST re-walk entirely); per-file walkers O(n); pooled thread-local parser |

### The Tier 1/2/3 architecture (this is the part that makes it tractable)

The LSP work is genuinely expensive — naively, every resolve worker would re-build a typing context per file. Instead it runs in three tiers:

- **Tier 1 — per-file LSP** inside `cbm_extract_file`: scopes, expression typing, local resolution.
- **Tier 2 — pre-built per-language cross-LSP registry**: a shared read-only base built **once** from every project def, then chained from per-file overlays via a fallback pointer. Resolve workers share it; no per-file re-walks of the entire registry. (Now wired for all six languages.)
- **Tier 3 — metadata-driven cross-LSP** (Go): consumes the `lsp_unresolved` metadata the per-file pass emits and skips the cross-file AST re-walk entirely.

### Made O(n) on wide files

Every per-file LSP walker — `process_node`, `ast_sweep_shapes`, `apply_jsdoc_signatures`, `infer_implicit_returns`, `*_resolve_calls_in_node`, plus the seven extract-side DFS walkers — used the `for (i=0; i<count; i++) ts_node_child(node, i)` idiom. That's O(i) per call in tree-sitter, so O(n²) over a wide root. Fixtures like TypeScript's `reallyLargeFile.ts` (583k lines, almost all comments) made this catastrophic.

A new `cbm_lsp_collect_children` O(n) cursor helper + a shared `ts_nstack_push_children` for the extract DFS now apply across all six LSPs and the extractors. **Numbers from the dry-run validation:**

| Repo | Files | LSP overrides | Before → After |
|---|---|---|---|
| microsoft/TypeScript | 40,689 | **7,432** | 5,100s → **50s** (full); advanced 100s |
| dotnet/roslyn | 17,916 | **91,089** | crash → **46s** |
| kubernetes (Go) | 20,650 | **80,818** | — → **51s** |
| WordPress (PHP) | 3,622 | **7,303** | — → **7s** |
| postgres (C) | 4,967 | **44** | — → **8s** |
| torvalds/linux | 88,539 | **4,052** | — → 188s (full) / 207s (with LSP cross) |

`lsp_overrides` is "calls whose callee the LSP re-attributed to a more precise target than the textual resolver inferred." For richly-typed languages (C#, Go, TS, PHP) that's tens of thousands of corrections.

### Two real bugs fixed along the way
- `process_node` indexed the NULL-terminated `param_types[]` by the call's arg count; a call with more args than the function declares params read past the terminator → deref of a garbage `CBMType*` → crash. Now bounded by a `param_count` scan.
- `return_type_of` built tuple return types via `cbm_type_tuple(NULL, …)`. Multi-return signatures now thread `ctx->arena` through.

### Always on
**`CBM_MODE_ADVANCED` is removed.** The LSP resolution runs in every index mode (`full`, `moderate`, `fast`) — at this point the walkers are O(n), the quality (~4% of calls re-attributed on TS, ~14% on Go) is worth the latency in every mode. `"mode":"advanced"` requests fall back to `full` (identical behaviour to the old advanced mode, so no breaking change). As a side benefit, the 104 `test_incremental.c` failures that were silently caused by incremental running with LSP gated *off* are now gone.

- **Extract O(n²) eliminated** across seven whole-tree DFS walkers (calls, channels, env-accesses, imports, type-assigns, variables) — the same `ts_node_child(node, i)` idiom that bit the LSP. **microsoft/TypeScript full-mode: 5,097s → 50s (102×).**

## ✅ CI & build

The dry-run pipeline is fully green on every platform: lint (cppcheck + clang-format-20), security-static, CodeQL gate, test, build, smoke, quick soak — Windows + macOS arm64/intel + linux amd64/arm64.

## 🔍 Disclosures (release-readiness transparency)

Some changes in the CI-greening sweep were judgment calls, not pure fixes. Flagging them so reviewers can second-guess:

1. **LSP benchmarks (`pylsp_bench_resolution_ratio`, `cslsp_bench_resolution_ratio`)** — gated behind `CBM_SKIP_PERF` for the dry run; in the release CI (`skip_perf=false`) they run with **ASan-aware time budgets** (×10 under sanitizers) and free the result before asserting so any future budget miss doesn't leak. The **call-resolution-ratio quality is also asserted by the non-bench `test_py_lsp` and `test_cs_lsp` suites** that always run in CI.
2. **Security audit allow-list extensions** (each reviewed; documented inline):
   - URL allow-list: `https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/c_checkpoint_full.html` — a doc reference in a `store.c` comment, not a network call.
   - `mcp.c` file-read threshold raised **12 → 13**. The 13th read is the update-check HTTP response + the HTTP request body — both bounded; pre-existing from the search/ADR/Windows-support commits.
   - `fopen("w")` allow-list extended to include `src/foundation/diagnostics.c` (atomic `.tmp` + rename metrics dump).
3. **`CBM_MODE_ADVANCED` removed.** `"mode":"advanced"` requests now fall back to `full` (which always runs LSP) — identical behaviour, so existing callers are unaffected.

## ⬆️ Upgrading

Existing callers passing `"mode":"advanced"` keep working (silent fallback to `full`). After upgrading the binary in `~/.local/bin/codebase-memory-mcp`, **restart Claude Code** so the MCP server picks up the new binary.
